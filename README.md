# About
Multiplayer trivia game using questions from "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire". You can create rooms to play with other people and pick different difficulties.

# Running Locally
To run locally, clone the repo, install the dependencies (```npm i```), and start the server (```fastapi dev server.py```). However, the frontend is set to use the hosted server address by default, so you'd need to also update constants.ts to use localhost instead.
